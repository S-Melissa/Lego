A few insights on Lego bricks and sets

Datasets can be found in the following link : https://github.com/shukkkur/Exploring-The-History-of-Lego

**Questions**

*How many colors exist among the Lego bricks ?*
*How many sets were created and released throughout the years ?*
*Is there a specific theme particularily represented ?*

**Obstacles**

*I did not encounter any real obstacle in this project.*

**Conclusions**

*There seem to be an evolution on the themes represented over the year. Oh, and at the time of the dataset, there was 135 existing colors of bricks !*

**Further work**

*I would like to have an insight on the prices of the different sets to analyze its evolution over the year and compare it to the general evolution of the prices.*
